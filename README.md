# Understand Business Objectives – 
Through meetings and calls  with stakeholders you should get an outline of Goals from the entire endeavor. Asking open ended questions will help you gain more insights to understand the data and how this dashboard will help achieve a specific business goal.

# Define Scope –
This is the perfect stage to discuss Key Metrics, KPIs & Deployment Timelines. Document the calculations, time frames & scope which will help in setting the expectations and avoiding any future disagreements. Also as a best practice remember to keep a 20% buffer while finalizing deadlines because it’s always better to over deliver after a standard commitment than to underdeliver after an extraordinary delivery pitch.
